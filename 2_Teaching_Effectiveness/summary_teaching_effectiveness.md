# Teaching Philosophy - Everyone Can Excel at Mathematics
One of the fundamental assumptions that drive my teaching is that every student, regardless of background, age, or a million other factors, can excel at mathematics. Many of the students that come into our classroom believe "they are not math people" as if people are born to do mathematics. Due to the hirearchial nature of mathematics, topics build on other topics. Students, through no fault of their own, may not have the necessary foundation to immediately jump into the topic of the course. Students preceive this as "failing" or "not being good at math", but it just means they aren't ready *yet*. My strategies to teaching rely on bridging the gap between where students are and where we want them to be in the course. 

Regardless of the modality I employ, students need a great deal feedback. I commonly achieve this feedback through technology. When building skills like solving equations or practicing mathematics, I rely on online homework systems. This does not just mean paid third party software as I have previously written my own open-source homework system for College Algebra. For students who are struggling with their homework, I will use portions of this open-source homework system to fill gaps in their knowledge. For example, students commonly have difficulty with factoring trinomials. My open-source homework page for factoring can be found at: https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/ufmac1105/coreModules/module4Activity/factoringTrinomials. Students that are struggling are sent to this page for additional help that breaks down the topic in easy-to-understand stages. A long-term goal is to create such an open-source homework system specific to math courses here at ERAU-W. Moreover, I am constantly learning about new academic technology to enhance student learning. I developed an interactive to help students visualize and check their answers for a particularly challenging discussion problem. I am currently extending that interactive to be a full discovery-based learning activity that responds as students posit how to progress in a question with multiple ways to find the answer. The key to these types of activties are that they get students to engage with the material until they respond in expected ways. With traditional textbook homework that students *may* find answers to some of their work in the back of a book, these activities allow students to re-adjust their thinking before it turns to long-term memory. My wealth of additionial learning resources lets me help students who may have a larger gap than others catch up to the expectations of the course and succeed.

For activities where automated feedback isn't appropriate, I encourage peer feedback around *how* students think and not on getting "correct" answers. Students reviewing other students' work is an effective way for students to reflect on topics they have already seen and reinforce concepts. In these activities, students are graded on their effort to provide feedback rather than provide correct answers. For example, when I developed discussion activities for Math 111, student replies to others had purpose. Rather than just checking if a student solved an equation "correctly", students critically reviewed others' Study Guides, Concept Videos, and how students solved a question. Students have responded positively to the focus on process over product, as illustrated in my reflection on student course evaluations. Peer feedback in group work was most effective in the EagleVision October 2022 course I taught. Body language and tone of voice are far easier to convey in person, which led students to feel comfortable sharing their sometimes erroneous thoughts with their group or the class in general.

I have run two teaching experiements with Math 111 - one of the courses I am the Course Developer and Course Mentor. The first examined student Show Work, scores on midterm/final, and their understandng of fundamental concepts in the course. The Show Work illuminated new ways students thought as they approached problems specific to the ERAU-W course that I've incorporated in automated feedback I've written. The comparison of scores on midterm/final and understanding of fundamental concepts showed me students can generally do well on the high-stakes assignments that are currently in the course, but that this does not translate into learning concepts. To that end, I'm designing an activity much like a "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" story. This activity will rely on automated feedback (based in the Show Work analysis of how ERAU-W students think) to walk students through the process of solving a typical precalculus question. Unlike assignments students might see in paid third-party sites, the focus is on how students think as they solve the problem. The activity will prompt the student to (1) consider any additional information they want to solve for, (2) approached they want to take, and (3) encourage students to extend their process to a similar question. There will be hidden trackers that save student responses throughout the process to check if students are making mathematically sound steps as they go and providing feedback if they do not. This focus on the process both aligns with my overall teaching enviornment of process of product as well as engenders high-level mathematical thinking. A follow-up study will test whether merely completing this activity is predictive of student understanding and could form the foundation of a non-traditional summative assessment to replace high-stakes exams.

Students have responded overwhelmingly positively to my methods of teaching courses at ERAU-W. As noted in my reflection on Student Course Evaluations, 45/46 were entirely positive and noted the extensive feedback I provide students, the numerous helpful resources I have when needed, and the accepting environment I engender with my process over product mentality.
