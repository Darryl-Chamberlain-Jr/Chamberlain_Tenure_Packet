<ins>Brief Description by Academic Year:</ins> 

**AY 21-22**: Initially, this project focused on developing automated feedback for traditional assignments such as homework, quizzes, and exams. After collecting data funded by the ERAU-W SEED grant **[1]**, I discovered that ERAU-W students performed well (enough) on traditional assignments but exhibited elementary conceptions of key mathematical concepts such as function, variable, and vector. This lead to a re-design of the MATH 111 course to incorporate discussions that engaged students in developing more sophisticated conceptions of key mathematical concepts. In the interim, I resubmitted a journal article **[3]** on a previous course redesign utilizing automated feedback that covers similar content to our MATH 111 course. The article was eventually accepted and published in AY 22-23.

**AY 22-23**: While designing a study to explore the impacts of the MATH 111 discussion redesign, I explored ways to leverage technology to improve students' mathematical conceptions through non-traditional assignments. This led to engaging in two major professional development actitives: (1) taking 5 Coursera courses to earn a certificate in Data Science and (2) attending a 5-day workshop on authoring dynamic mathematical activities through a webpage. The certificate in Data Science prepared me to incorporate Machine Learning in both my work on designing automated feedback as well as enhancing my research data management and analysis skills. The 5-day workshop on authoring dynamic mathematical activities allowed me to develop dynamic, non-traditional assignments that would incorporate the automated feedback I had previously established. Moreover, the additional training these professional development activities provided allowed me to be a leader in technology in mathematics education and cohost a workshop **[2]** on technology at a national mathematics education research conference (RUMEC). I was also asked to speak at a mathematics department **[4]** on incorporating technology into mathematics education research, likely due to cohosting the workshop at the high-profile conference. 

**AY 23-24**: To formally develop and study one of the dynamic, non-traditional assignments that I began creating as part of the workshop, I have applied for a small grant **[5]** from the NSF-funded project that hosted the 5-day workshop I attended. In addition, I'm using the skills I learned as part of the certificate in Data Science to integrate Machine Learning into another project and am leading a paper and presentation **[6]** to present this new avenue of research in collegiate mathematics education. These efforts will help me prepare for the NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant **[7]** on integrating machine learning into Collegiate Mathematics Education Research due in July 2024. The NSF CAREER grant is a highly prestigious grant that "Supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization" [(NSF Funding Opportunity)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/faculty-early-career-development-program-career). I've already spoken with NSF Program Officers about the project in general and received advice to present the strongest submission possible.

## **Co-PI**: ***Community of Inquiry and Cognitive Load***

<ins>Research Team:</ins> Emily Faulconer (PI) and Beverly Wood (Co-PI)

<ins>Funding Source:</ins> Externally funded through NSF, 6/15/21--5/31/24

<ins>Roles:</ins> Student Worker Management, Data Management, Data Analysis, Manuscript Writing, Presentations

<ins>Brief Description by Year:</ins>

**AY 21-22:** I was recruited to join this NSF grant **[1]** shortly after starting at ERAU-W to provide data management and analysis expertise. In particular, I was tasked with partially automating the manual data collection process. As part of the project, student discussion posts were copied, pasted into a Word document, manually separated by sentence, and manually deidentified. I wrote several Python scripts to:
1. Scrape PDF files for student and instructor posts.
2. Split all post by sentence and tag the speaker. 
3. Deidentify all student and instructor names.
4. Tag all sentences by term, year, course, and section. 
I shared these scripts and tips on managing large collections of data locally at a Lunch & Learn series **[3]**.

As I led this data management, it made sense for me to also lead the group of 6 student researchers we had qualitatively coding these sentences. I also developed Excel sheets to analyze data in a flexible and generic way. We presented preliminary results at a national education conference **[2]** and turned the presentation into an accepted journal publication **[4]**. 

**AY 22-23**: After numerous attempts to improve the accuracy of PDF scrapes, I refined our data collection and management process by obtaining the discussion post data via Canvas API. Moreover, I wrote Python scripts to perform analysis on the ever-increasing data we collected. At submission of this packet, we have about 900,000 sentences from student discussions from 17 terms of MATH 111 and PHYS 102 (note: Excel regularly crashes when working with 100,000+ rows and thus data necessarily needed to be restructured for large-scale analysis). I continued to oversee the 6 student researchers as they qualtitatively analyzed approximately 200,000 sentences from discussions. 

**AY 23-24**: Student coders have finished enough data analysis that we can prepare manuscripts. I am leading efforts on a presentation and paper **[5]** on the use of technology for data management as well as automating the coding process using our extensive database of sentences coded to train a machine learning model.

# Internally-Funded Research Projects
## **PI/Co-PI**: ***Collective Knowledge Progression and Proliferation in Asynchronous Calculus Discussion Boards***

<ins>Research Team:</ins> Zackery Reed (PI/Co-PI) and Karen Keene (co-PI posthumous)

<ins>Funding:</ins> Internally through ERAU-W Faculty SEED grant, 2/1/23--6/31/23.

<ins>Roles:</ins> All aspects of the project in equal parts with collaborators. PIs Chamberlain and Reed take turns leading parts of the project. 

<ins>Brief Description by Year</ins> 

**AY 21-22**
Shortly after starting at ERAU-W, the three collegiate mathematics education researchers in the department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology formed a math eduation research group. After exploring and negotiating what we would work on, we decided to work on how students develop knowledge in ERAU-W discussions. We also agreed to work as equal collaborators as we all had similar research skills. We presented our initial theoretical framework first at a regional conference **[1]**, then at a national conference **[2]**. Unfortunately due to Dr. Keene's health, she stepped away from the project in Febuary 2022 to recover. Dr. Reed and I took preliminary data available from Dr. Reed's course to iteratively apply and refine our theoretical framework. 

**AY 22-23**
After Dr. Keene recovered and rejoined the group in August 2022, we again negotiated the refinements of the theoertical framework. We applied to and were awarded an internal grant **[3]** to formally collect data and hire undergraduate researchers to apply our theoretical framework to the data. Dr. Keene suddenly passed in February 2023 just before our research group hosted a national conference workshop **[4]** as well as presented key preliminary insights to the new theoretical framework **[5]**. Continuing with the data collected and analyzed from the internal SEED grant, Dr. Reed and I submitted an abstract for a book chapter **[6]** on Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online. This abstract was accepted in July 2023. 

**AY 23-24**
Dr. Reed and I will continue to work on the Book Chapter **[6]** as well as analyze the data collected as part of the internal SEED grant. We are actively recruiting an additional researcher to join the project before submitting for external funding.

## **PI**: ***Undergraduate Covariational Reasoning in Calculus***

<ins>Research Team:</ins> Teegan Bailey (undergraduate co-PI), Konstantina Christodoulopoulou (co-PI)

<ins>Funding Source:</ins> Internal (to University of Florida) support for undergraduate research, 2021-2023.

<ins>Roles:</ins> Faculty advisor, manuscript writing

<ins>Brief Description by Year</ins>

**AY 21-22**
Before joining ERAU-W, I served as Teegan Bailey's faculty research advisor. While Dr. Christodoulopoulou formally became Bailey's advisor, I continued mentoring Bailey. We meet at least once every two weeks to discuss mathematics education theory and/or progress in his research project. This led to his first presentation and publication **[1]**. 

**AY 22-23**
Dr. Christodoulopoulou took a primarily role in guiding Bailey with collecting data for his second research project. While data was collected, Bailey began applying to graduate programs outside of collegiate mathematics education and thus discontinued working on the research. This project is now complete.
