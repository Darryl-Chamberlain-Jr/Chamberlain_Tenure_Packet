# Teaching Effectiveness
<!---
    Excellence in teaching is central to the mission and vision of the College. As such, COAS embraces a philosophy of teaching effectiveness that emphasizes knowledge of subject matter, enthusiasm in the classroom, and continuous improvement through the incorporation of new teaching methods and materials. Faculty are expected to effectively communicate with students, facilitate learning in the classroom, and promote attainment of Student Learning Outcomes and General Education Competencies. These activities should be fostered through regular participation in pedagogical development opportunities and appropriate course maintenance and redevelopments. All candidates for tenure and promotion to Associate Professor must demonstrate excellence in teaching. The portfolio should include the following:--->
<!--- Overview --->
<!---
    The overview should describe a teaching philosophy of how the candidate approaches teaching in a manner that engenders student learning. This should include specifics about how the candidate implements their teaching philosophy, including 
        1) themes for teaching in multiple modalities (e.g., how teaching asynchronously online differs from teaching synchronously in the classroom face-to-face or via EagleVision); 
        2) methods used to determine whether teaching is effective; 
        3) ideas for using the assessment of student learning and student feedback to improve teaching effectiveness; 
        4) management of student-facilitated self-learning versus active engagement of students in learning; and, 
        5) reflections on the use of teaching experiences to improve future teaching performance. 
    The candidate should include a description of how they motivate students to learn. When reflecting on their performance, the candidate should use examples to illustrate both successes in fostering student learning (what worked and why?) and challenges faced (what did not work and why?). Finally, candidates should discuss their teaching philosophy in relation to academic discipline. For example, candidates should discuss how they believe students learn in their specific discipline and what they do to support that learning in their classes.

<!--- Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness --->
<!---
    Candidates should present evidence of their teaching effectiveness by including all available end- of-course student evaluations and Department Chair annual overall assessments conducted while in their current rank. Specifically, candidate portfolios must include artifacts from each of the following:
        A. annual performance evaluations from Department Chair, including self-evaluations;
        B. student course evaluations, including candidate reflections as appropriate (see also Faculty Handbook, Section 9.3.3, sub-section 3b1);
        C. peer Observations (See Peer Observations section below);
        D. additional evidence of teaching effectiveness as appropriate (See Additional Evidence section below).
    It is vital that candidates compose a self-assessment and reflection that demonstrate the ability to consider personal strengths and weaknesses, leading to a plan for continued excellence and targeted improvements.
--->

<!--- Peer Observations --->
<!---
    All candidates submitting a portfolio for tenure and promotion to Associate Professor consideration are required to have at least five peer observations, as delineated in the COAS Peer Observation of Teaching: Policies and Procedures document. Candidates should include a statement of personal reflection about the collective peer observations obtained. This reflection statement should include information about the impact of improvements in teaching practices as delineated in the peer observations, especially in ways that create impact beyond one's own classroom.

<!--- Additional Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness --->
<!---
    Examples of teaching effectiveness may include but are not limited to the following:
        teaching awards and/or recognitions;
        samples of major student projects such as capstone projects, theses, or dissertations;
        intra- and inter-department and/or college collaboration in teaching;
        participation in course development activities;
        teaching-related workshops and conferences conducted or attended, including level of participation and specific outcomes implemented into teaching practices;
        development or refinement of new engagement activities for students;
        evidence that the faculty member is willing to participate in high-impact student engagement
        opportunities (mentoring, internships and independent studies, or activities that foster university community partnerships);
        participation in faculty teaching development activities;
        participation in team teaching, or interdisciplinary teaching opportunities;
        special initiatives in teaching.
