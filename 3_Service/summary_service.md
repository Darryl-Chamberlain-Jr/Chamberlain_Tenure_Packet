# Service

<!--- 
    Candidates must demonstrate appropriate service to their department, college, campus, university, and professional community. Service commitments for a candidate will be determined annually in collaboration with the Department Chair. Candidates' portfolio should include evidence of varied, sustained and, typically, progressive levels of service.

    When appropriate, candidates may seek statements to contextualize service from committee chairs, Department Chairs, and professional peers. These statements may note the date(s) of a defined service contribution, the purpose and outcomes, and the candidate's specific contribution and impact. Candidates also may submit self-evaluations of their service commitments, including evidence of honors, awards, and other recognitions for service activities.

    Examples of service may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    Serving as an active and productive member of department, college, campus, and/or University committees;
        - Chairing committees at the department, college, campus, and/or university level
        - Providing leadership in defined capacities for the department, college, campus, University, and/or professional communities;
        - Participating in student recruitment, advisement, mentoring, and/or student organizations beyond the scope of normal teaching expectations;
        - Supporting and participating in the life and activities of the department as requested by the Department Chair;
        - Developing, implementing, or managing academic programs or projects serving as a peer reviewer for faculty observations;
        - Holding offices and committee assignments for professional organizations;
        - Editing and reviewing submissions to professional conferences and/or publications
        - Serving as a reviewer for internal and external grant applications;
