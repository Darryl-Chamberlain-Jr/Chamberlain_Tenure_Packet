    Brief Statement. Should be no more than six pages from the candidate that shows how her or his record supports the change of status requested. The statement should present citations of evidence from the candidate's curriculum vitae, resume, or other sources that are specifically related to the candidate's: (a) quality and effectiveness of teaching; (b) scholarly and professional activity; (c) service; and (d) promise for sustained future development and scholarly activity.

In this package, I will show without a doubt that I have exceeded the expectations for promotion to Associate Professor. In this brief statement, I'll outline how I've exceeded each faculty pillar of teaching, research, and service. 

# Teaching Excellence

ERAU-W COAS expects Associate Professors to demonstrate excellence in teaching. This is described in the Guidelines and Criteria document as follows:

>COAS embraces a philosophy of teaching effectiveness that emphasizes knowledge of subject matter, enthusiasm in the classroom, and continuous improvement through the incorporation of new teaching methods and materials. Faculty are expected to effectively communicate with students, facilitate learning in the classroom, and promote attainment of Student Learning Outcomes and General Education Competencies. These activities should be fostered through regular participation in pedagogical development opportunities and appropriate course maintenance and redevelopments. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics with a research focus in Collegiate Mathematics Education (in other words, how undergraduates develop their understanding of high level mathematical concepts). My student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive and explicitly mention my clear command of the content in the courses I teach as well as my enthusiasm for mathematics wth comments such as *"This professor made math come to life for me. He's a thorough teacher and communicates in a way that is understandable."* 

With my background in Collegiate Mathematics Education, I am constantly incorporating new methods and materials. My specific focus is on educational technologies that provide automated feedback. I have written and incorporated online homework systems, digital interactives, and innovative activities that engage students with high level mathematical concepts. I have also incorporated traditional active learning when teaching EagleVision sections, as noted by Zackery Reed's peer observation of my October 2022 Math 111 section. From his review:
>Dr. Chamberlain demonstrates a productive balance of direct instruction (i.e., lecture) and active learning activities. This suggests an intentional awareness of student attention span needs, and more importantly an implementation of currently known best practices for mathematics pedagogy.
