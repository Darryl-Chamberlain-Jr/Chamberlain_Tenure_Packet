# Overview
I have actively served at all levels of ERAU-W as well as in my professional community. In just my first two years at ERAU-W, I participated in the College of Arts & Science's Faculty Council as well as chaired the ERAU-W Faculty Senate Academic Technology committee. After the sudden passing of Dr. Karen Keene in February 2023, I stepped up to serve as Associate Chair of the department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology in addition to the various service I perform for my department. Outside of Embry-Riddle, I am involved in the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the Special Interest Group on Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education (RUME). The MAA is the largest national association of American and Canadian mathematicians with a membership of over 24,000. RUME was the first Special Interest Group of the MAA and is the largest national association of collegiate mathematics education researchers in the United States. I serve on the MAA Council on Teaching and Learning as well as the chair for the Subcommittee on Technology in Mathematics Education. These groups allow for interaction and influence of college educators, especially with relation to technology. I also serve small committees in RUME as a stepping stone toward running for a leadership role within the research community. Outside of ERAU and my professional communities, I serve as a frequent journal reviewer and grant reviewer for the National Science Foundation. For journals, I am commonly called on to review papers on APOS Theory, a theoretical framework I have published on, as well as student learning through technology. For grants, I commonly review for the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) initative. 

I have itemized my service by category and provided a brief explanation for each below.

*SIGMAA on RUME is the premier national research group on college-level mathematics education. The annual conference programming committeee provides additional reviews on potential conference proceedings and reviews all conflicting proceedings reviews. The leadership nominations committee solicits and evaluates nominees for any open officer positions within the group. The committee then sends forward the final ballet of nominees to the RUME secretary for general voting.*

- **NSF Grant Reviewer** panelist for National Science Foundation grant panels, 2022--present.

*I have served on 2 panels. Serving on an NSF panel requires careful reading of approximately 9 grant proposals. For 2 of these proposals, you lead all discussion and provide a panel review for the proposal. For 5 of these proposals, you act as a secondary reader that provides critical review of the proposal. For the rest of the proposals, you act as a tertiary reader that provides overall review of the proposal.*
